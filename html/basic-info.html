    <div class="basic-info-intro">
        <h2>His Early Life</h2>
        <p>Xu Xin was born on January 8, 1990, in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, 
            China. He began playing table tennis when he was 5 years old and got
            his first championships in 2004. He then enrolled in the National Second
            Team in February 2006 and promoted to National First Team in the same October.
        </p>

        <h2>Playing Style</h2>
        <div class="basic-info-img" id="basic-info-img1">Young Xuxin</div>
        <p>Xuxin is famous for his untraditional penhold grip and his powerful and spinny forehand loops, 
            His footworks and his creativities in tactics can often surprise everyone, when 
            you are expecting him to use his backhand, he can perform a decent behind-the-back shot
            and ultimately earns the point. The title of "People's Artist" was just earned like that.  
            He has also demonstrated an exceptional control on mid-to-long distance shots, he frequently 
            pulls off high lobs from afar to stay in the rally, turning defense into attack and then 
            winning the point.
        </p>

        <h2>Personality & Off the Table</h2>
        <p>Outside of the table, Xu Xin is known for his humour. During many after-match interviews and 
            separate interviews, his responses can show his professionality with no damage in his 
            humours.
